Building the library
============================
Ant is used for building the library.

   $ ant clean                # Clean the build/ directory
   $ ant compile              # Compiles library classes into build/
   $ ant jar                  # Create a jar for the library
   $ ant test                 # Execute JUnit Tests

The latter command outputs the jar to build/jar/ubidots.jar.

Notes about dependencies
============================
All dependencies are provided into the libs/ directory for convinience. However,
the compiled jar does not bundle them. End-users wishing to use the Java library
must add the dependencies to their project themselves.
